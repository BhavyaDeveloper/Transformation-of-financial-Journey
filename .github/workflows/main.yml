Speed time to value and maximize the impact of finance transformation efforts
Leading finance transformation is the No. 1 priority for CFOs this year — but reality is falling short of the leadership vision, as rising organizational complexity makes it challenging to deliver on key transformation objectives.

Finance is undergoing relentless innovation, from accelerating digitization to refining delivery models, role profiles and skills. To ensure the success of those innovations, focus on the following: 

Balance finance transformation efforts spanning multiple technologies, processes, people, data and organizational structure. Reconciling the many interdependencies across distinct workstreams requires objective prioritization, a willingness to flex as priorities shift, and healthy external partnerships with providers that support finance transformation efforts.

Manage organizational complexity (a major complicating factor in finance transformation). Design programs to create holistic — rather than isolated — solutions. For example, as finance becomes more digital, efforts to build a highly scaled organizational structure will require new ways of working so staff can effectively cut through team-, project- and location-specific silos. This requires intelligently pairing redesign efforts across teams, roles, skills and spans of control with finance technology and process harmonization improvements.
